# MealFinder

## Description

A site that uses mealdb's api to allow for a user to search for different recipes based on a single keyword. For example if a user enters cheese the site will display all recipes with cheese as a main ingredient. The user can then select a recipe by clicking on an image and the full recipe will appear. The site can also generate random recipes if the user clicks on the randomise button next to the search bar. The site is built using HTML, CSS, + JavaScript and makes uses of a third party api (mealdb.com).
